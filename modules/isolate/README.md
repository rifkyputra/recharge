# isolate

This Section is about using isolate in an app. For simplicity i only use compute function that has been provided by flutter.

i choose factorial because of the algorithm is quite simple. there is an input of how many factorial to calculate. and a toggle to turn on or off the isolate.

depends on your device, the bigger factorial eventually will block the main thread when isolate is turned off.
